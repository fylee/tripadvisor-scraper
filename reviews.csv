UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Glimpse of a Reality Living in Laos,I think it is important for visitors to see this unique story that is part of Laos’ history and still has affects today. You won’t need more than an hour to see it all and it is air conditioned!,5.0,Aug 2025,,,Ty & Lorin,,26,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Heart-wrenching but informative,"Heart-wrenching but so informative. I think every tourist to Laos should visit one of the UXO museums to truly understand what Laos has been through, and is still dealing with. The museum is small but excellent, and the films are really moving.",5.0,Jun 2025,,,intrepidpam,,328,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,"Sad, but a reality, which everyone should see to avoid more wars. Actualment. appear children c/mutilations.","Surprisingly, a ""silent"" war, as little has been heard of the bombing of 80,000,000 bombs launched p/B52 from the US",4.0,May 2025,,en-x-mtfrom-pt,MMendes,,45,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Very humbling and worthy of our support,This is a must if you want to understand what has happened to this land in the 60’s and 70’s. It’s incredibly humbling to see the work going into this region. Highly recommend,5.0,Mar 2025,,,Nick Epps,,118,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Worth the visit,Very somber experience. Take your time to read the boards and watch the video. To get the realisation of how very real the danger still is - to children in particular - is scary,5.0,Feb 2025,,,toniash77,,9,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,History of bombing of Laos on display,"This is a sad history of Laos I wanted to see. Bombs and accessories displayed for the tourists, so they can imagine (with the maps) the entire extent of the massive bombing.",5.0,Feb 2025,,,Marek Bocanek,,504,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Museum to do!!,"Go see this museum! It is very small, but it is a real layer! It helps to understand the situation in Laos with regard to the millions of bombs still present in the country. The film at the end is poignant. Admission is free, but it is possible in a donation.",4.0,Jan 2025,,en-x-mtfrom-fr,Aurélie,,12,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Not worth even the free visit,Unfortunately this museum was very disappointing to visit and I'm surprised with the high reviews. It was just a single room and even the lights were not turned on. The only thing there were some bombs and some very basic information. The similar museums in Cambodia were a lot more informative and interesting.,1.0,Dec 2024,,,Sean_kti,,82,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,Sad Story,"Most of the UXO work in Laos is sponsored by the USA so there is nothing critical being shown or said about who caused this problem. This centre here is very similar to the one (COPE) in Vientiane so there is no need to visit both, even the videos are the same. The focus here is on the danger, education and mine clearing. If you wish to visit another one that is slightly different, you should visit MAG UXO (Vientiane, Thakhek, Phonsavan).",3.0,Nov 2024,,,Andrew Y,,5,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
UXO Lao Visitors Centre,What war leaves behind,We came across this whilst we we out walking. It’s not an easy place to visit but well worth spending half an hour reading the stories and the continued problems the country is suffering from. All credit to those who are trying to make a difference through education and bomb clearance,4.0,Oct 2024,,,hartlovap,,345,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d3671945-Reviews-UXO_Lao_Visitors_Centre-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html
